For a given number n check if it is prime or not. A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Examples :

Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5 has 2 factors 1 and 5 only.
Input: n = 25
Output: 0
Explanation: 25 has 3 factors 1, 5, 25
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPrime() which takes an integer n as input parameters and returns an integer, 1 if n is a prime number or 0 otherwise.

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 109

Solution:

class Solution{
    static int isPrime(int N){
        // code here
        if(N==1 || N==0)
        return 0;
        for(int i=2;i*i<=N;i++){
            if(N%i==0)
            return 0;
        }
        return 1;
    }
}
