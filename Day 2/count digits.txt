Given a number n. Count the number of digits in n which evenly divide n. Return an integer, total number of digits of n which divides n evenly.

Note :- Evenly divides means whether n is divisible by a digit i.e. leaves a remainder 0 when divided.
 

Examples :

Input: n = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.
Input: n = 2446
Output: 1
Explanation: Here among 2, 4, 6 only 2 divides 2446 evenly while 4 and 6 do not.
Input: n = 23
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 and 3, none of them divide 23 evenly.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1<= n <=105

Solution:

class Solution{
    static int evenlyDivides(int n){
        // code here
        int cnt=0;
        int temp=n;
        while(n>0)
        {
            int t=n%10;
            if(t!=0 && temp%t==0 )
            cnt++;
            n=n/10;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
