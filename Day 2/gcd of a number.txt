Given two positive integers a and b, find GCD of a and b.

Note: Don't use the inbuilt gcd function

Example 1:

Input: 
a = 3
b = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: GCD of 3 and 6 is 3

Example 2:

Input: 
a = 1
b = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: GCD of 1 and 1 is 1

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function gcd() which takes two positive integers as input parameters and returns gcd of a and b as an integer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b)))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109

Solution:

Using recursion:


class Solution {
    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        return b==0 ? a : gcd(b,(a%b));
    }
}

without recursion:

class Solution {
    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        while(b!=0)
        {
            int temp=a%b;
            a=b;
            b=temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
