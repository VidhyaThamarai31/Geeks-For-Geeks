Given an integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.

Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number

Examples:

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.
Expected Time Complexity: O(logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 107

Solution:

class Solution {
    long floorSqrt(long n) {
        if(n==0 || n==1)
        return n;
        long i=0,result=1;
        while(result<=n)
        {
           i++;
           result=i*i;
        }
        return i-1;
    }
}
