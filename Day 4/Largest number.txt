Given an array, arr. The task is to find the largest element in it.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 8, 7, 56, 90]
Output: 90
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 90.
Input: arr = [5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 5.
Input: arr = [10]
Output: 10
Explanation: There is only one element which is the largest.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size()<= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 106

Solution:

class Solution {
    public static int largest(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int large=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int n=arr.length;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]>large)
            {
                large=arr[i];
            }
        }
        return large;
    }
}
